I joined [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en)'s [EMSEC](https://www.irisa.fr/emsec/) team in September 2014 as a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science. I am working on cryptography, security and data privacy and, these days, more specifically on symmetric searchable encryption.

I received my Master's Degree from [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/) in May 2013, where I spent 9 very exciting month. I went to Brown after completing my undergraduate studies and one year of master during three marvelous years spent at the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/jsp/accueil.jsp?LANGUE=1) in France.

I also had the chance to work at MIT, in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with Shafi Goldwasser and Raluca Ada Popa.

I am also the developer of [DrawBerry](http://raphaelbost.free.fr/DrawBerry.html), an open source vector drawing application for Mac OS X.

In previous years, I served in the French Air Force, worked in a French construction company or more recently at Inria.

Away from keyboard, I am also interested in Defense and Geopolitics problems, as well as turkey cooking techniques.
