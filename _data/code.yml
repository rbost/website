- title: OpenSSE
  description: "I have implemented several searchable encryption schemes, including verifiable schemes, forward or backward secure schemes, such as Σoφoς, Diana or Janus. The OpenSSE project encompasses several repos for useful components, such as a library offering an abstraction of high-level cryptographic components (pseudo-random functions, trapdoor permutations, ...)."

- title: Algo_Elim
  description: "This is the project I worked onto during Summer 2012 at the Inria. It is a program transformer written in CaML and which eliminates square roots and division operations in a program. The original code has been written as Ph.D. Thesis material by Pierre Néron and I designed ways to reduce the size of the output code. A synthesis of my work can be found here (in French)."
