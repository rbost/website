	My research interests cover cryptography, security and privacy, and in particular applied cryptography, provable security, design and implementation of cryptographic protocols. Most of my recent works focus on searchable encryption (see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/">Publications</a> page), through which I also had to look at the security of software implementation, theoretical algorithmics, and statistics.

I received Masters degrees from Brown University and Ecole Polytechnique (France), and got my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/phd/">Ph.D.</a> from Université de Rennes 1, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/">Pierre-Alain Fouque</a> and <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/index.php">David Pointcheval</a>.
